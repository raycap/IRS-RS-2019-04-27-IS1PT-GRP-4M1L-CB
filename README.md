## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
The evolution of artificial intelligence has became a hot topic in the recent year. While comparing between artificial intelligence and chatbots, chatbots are only a faint splash on a huge wave of progress. In the recent days, the number of users of social media messaging apps like Slack, Whatsapps, Telegrama and Skype are skyrocketing,  Facebook Messenger alone has achieved the milestone of 1.2 billion monthly users. With the increasing of popularity of messaging apps, virtual chatbots that imitate human conversations for solving various tasks are becoming a trend and is an inevitable process to move towards an advanced society. Chinese WeChat bots nowadays provide a fancy function to minimize the repetitive process, such as setting medical appointments, calling a taxi, sending money to friends, check in for a flight and so on.

When come to the sector of automating customer support, online chatbots will come in handy to save time and more efficient. Gartner forecasts that by 2020, over 85% of customer interactions will be handled without a human. However, the advantages provided by chatbot systems exceeded the expectation of an ordinary system that give responses to customersâ€™ inquiries. They also provide function such as collecting information about users, reducing overhead costs and helping to organize meetings. It is undoubtedly that size of the chatbot market is growing exponentially.

Looking at the current website of ISS, there is still a big improvement that could be made to help our next batch of student in better understanding the ISS programme. Our team has applied the techniques learned in class and scraped the information from the existing website to develop a chatbot. By utilizing the Dialogflow and Slack, it saves us the time to develop the backend and frontend yet achieving the optimized result. It will definitely be a good news for ISS applicants if the chatbot is successfully implemented in the ISS website.
